# w3.js
https://www.w3schools.com/w3js/

An unofficial repository.

## What's this?
W3.JS is a JavaScript library designed to simplify web development projects:
 * Easy to learn and easy to use.
 * Designed for fast application development.
 * Designed for all devices: PC, Tablet, and Mobile.
 * Free to use. No licenses.

## What Can W3.JS Do?
See the official website: https://www.w3schools.com/w3js/

## Who
I created this repository in GitHub as a direct download from the official website for these reasons:
1. There's no official repo _(that I can find at this moment, anyway)_
2. I like to have my projects dependencies in git repos and mentioned in documentation / package.json / deployment instructions
3. I have some needs for a few projects that this library resolves but some slight improvements may (or may not) be required. When and if I improve anything, will make it public through this repo.
